We denote the word sequence as Reading Sequence that is extracted from DocX files. The corresponding bounding boxes are extracted from the PDF files which are generated from DocX files. We propose a coloring scheme to solve the word duplication when we match each word and its bounding box.</paragraph>\n\n    <paragraph id=\"5.4\" layout_ids=\"4\">In this section, we introduce the data pipeline in detail, including document collection, reading sequence extraction, and layout alignment with the coloring scheme. The current ReadingBank totally includes 500,000 document pages, where the training set includes 400,000 document pages and both the validation set and the test set include 50,000 document pages, respectively.</paragraph>\n\n    <section id=\"5.5\" type=\"subsection\" reference_id=\"3.1\" title=\"3.1 Document Collection\">\n      <heading id=\"5.5.1\" layout_ids=\"5\">3.1 Document Collection</heading>\n      \n      <paragraph id=\"5.5.2\" layout_ids=\"6,10\">We crawl the WORD documents in DocX format from the internet considering the robots exclusion standard as well as the public domain license. We further use the language detection API with a high confidence threshold to filter non-English or bilingual documents because we focus on the reading order detection for English documents in this work. The reading order detection of other languages will be our future work. We only keep the pages with more than 50 words to guarantee the enough information on each page. In this way, we have totally collected 210,000 WORD documents in English and each page in the documents is informative enough. We further randomly select 500,000 pages to build our dataset.</paragraph>\n      \n      <annotation id=\"5.5.3\" for=\"5.5.2\" layout_ids=\"7\">More ethical details are included in the Ethical Consideration section.</annotation>\n      <annotation id=\"5.5.4\" for=\"5.5.2\" layout_ids=\"8,9\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/</annotation>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"5.6\" type=\"subsection\" reference_id=\"3.2\" title=\"3.2 Reading Sequence Extraction\">\n      <heading id=\"5.6.1\" layout_ids=\"11\">3.2 Reading Sequence Extraction</heading>\n      \n      <paragraph id=\"5.6.2\" layout_ids=\"12\">The reading order in ReadingBank refers to the order of words in the DocX files. Each DocX file is a compressed archive where its word sequence can be parsed from its internal Office XML code. We adopt an open source tool python-docx to parse the DocX file and extract the word sequence from the XML metadata. The tool also enables us to change the words' color for the layout alignment step.</paragraph>\n\n      <paragraph id=\"5.6.3\" layout_ids=\"13\">We first extract the paragraphs and the tables sequentially from the parsing result. Then we traverse the paragraphs line by line and the tables cell by cell and obtain the word sequence in the DocX file. We denote the sequence as [w\u2081, w\u2082, ..., w\u2099], where n is the number of words in this document. The obtained sequence is the reading order without the layout information and is denoted as the Reading Sequence. We would align the bounding box to each word in this sequence in the following steps.</paragraph>\n      \n      <annotation id=\"5.6.4\" for=\"5.6.2\" layout_ids=\"22\">https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/</annotation>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"5.7\" type=\"subsection\" reference_id=\"3.3\" title=\"3.3 Layout Alignment with Coloring Scheme\">\n      <heading id=\"5.7.1\" layout_ids=\"14\">3.3 Layout Alignment with Coloring Scheme</heading>\n      \n      <paragraph id=\"5.7.2\" layout_ids=\"15\">In our extensive collection, the same word may appear multiple times in the same document, and we need to solve this duplication when we assign the coordinates to each word. Therefore, we give each word an extra label indicating its appearance index. For example, given sequence [the, car, hits, the, bus], the extra labels should be [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] since there are two \"the\"s in this example. In this way, each pair of the word and its appearance index is unique and can serve as the key when assigning the location coordinates.</paragraph>\n\n      <paragraph id=\"5.7.3\" layout_ids=\"16\">Meanwhile, we propose the coloring scheme to show the keys in the DocX file without changing the original layout pattern. We map the appearance index to the RGB colors through C : N \u2192 RGB and color the words accordingly. To eliminate the interference from the original word color, we first color all the words into black.</paragraph>\n\n      <table id=\"5.7.4\" layout_ids=\"17,18,19,20,21\">\n        <row>\n          <cell>r = i&0x110000</cell>\n        </row>\n        <row>\n          <cell>g = i&0x001100</cell>\n        </row>\n        <row>\n          <cell>b = i&0x000011</cell>\n        </row>\n        <row>\n          <cell>C(i) = (R : r, G : g, B : b)</cell>\n        </row>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n  </section>\n</page>\n</previous_page>\n\n2.

Analyze the inputs carefully.\n2. Create a list of each leaf node element present on the page. The types of leaf nodes are: paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image. List these in their natural reading order. Each list item should represent one leaf node.\n3. Review the leaf nodes and determine if any are continuations from the previous page.

Note that TREC DL19/20 are search tasks defined on MS-MARCO and there, all the fine-tuned models are richly supervised. On TREC DL19, HyDE shows comparable map and ndcg@10 to ContrieverFT and best recall@1k. On DL20, HyDE gets around 10% lower map and ndcg@10 than ContrieverFT and similar recall@1k. The ANCE model shows better ndcg@10 numbers than HyDE but lower recall, suggesting it may be biased to a subset of queries and/or relevant documents.\n    </paragraph>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"6.4\" type=\"subsection\" title=\"4.3 Low Resource Retrieval\" reference_id=\"4.3\">\n    <heading id=\"6.4.1\" layout_ids=\"6\">4.3 Low Resource Retrieval</heading>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"6.4.2\" layout_ids=\"7\">\n        In Table 2, we show retrieval results on low-resource tasks from BEIR. Similar to web search, HyDE again brings sizable improvements to Contriever across the board in terms of both ndcg and recall. HyDE is only outperformed by BM25 on one dataset, TREC-Covid but with a tiny 0.2 margin; in comparison, the underlying Contriever underperforms by more than 50%.\n    </paragraph>\n\n    <paragraph id=\"6.4.3\" layout_ids=\"8\">\n        We also observe HyDE demonstrates strong performance compared to fine-tuned models. HyDE generally shows better performance than ANCE and DPR, even though the two are fine-tuned on MS-MARCO and ANCE also involves some sophisticated hard negative techniques. ContrieverFT shows performance advantages on FiQA and DBPedia. These involve retrieval of financial posts or entities respectively.

Current Page:\nThis has been provided as the image\n\nYour task is to analyze these inputs and generate a structured XML output for the current page. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the inputs carefully.\n2. Create a list of each leaf node element present on the page. The types of leaf nodes are: paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image. List these in their natural reading order. Each list item should represent one leaf node.\n3. Review the leaf nodes and determine if any are continuations from the previous page. If so, identify the ids from the previous page that they continue from. Only output direct continuation and nothing else. Examples:\n    - A paragraph that starts on the previous page and is continues on the current page\n    - A table that starts on the previous page and is continues on the current page\n    - etc.\n4. For each footnote/annotation, identify the most natural paragraph or other element within the document which the annotation is referencing.\n5. Review the last section on the previous page. Determine if that section continues on the current page. If so, identify the id of the continuing section.\n\nWrap your analysis inside <page_analysis> tags to show your thought process and break down the information. This will ensure a thorough interpretation of the data. Limit your analysis to exactly these steps. Be clear and concise in your analysis. It's OK for this section to be quite long."

Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- paragraph: \"(6) The Cabinet Secretary may make Regulations for the better implementation of this section.\"\n- heading: \"6. The Income Tax Act is amended by inserting the following new section immediately after section 12F\u2014\"\n- annotation: \"Insertion of new sections 12G and 12H of Cap. 470.\"\n- annotation: \"Minimum top-up tax.\"\n- paragraph: \"(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a tax known as minimum top-up tax shall be payable by a covered person where the combined effective tax rate in respect of that person for a year of income is less than fifteen per cent.\"\n- paragraph: \"(2) The combined effective tax rate for a covered person shall be the sum of all the adjusted covered taxes, divided by the sum of all net income or loss for the year of income, multiplied by a hundred.\"\n- paragraph: \"(3) The amount of tax payable shall be the difference between fifteen per cent of the net income or loss for the year of income of a covered person, and the combined effective tax rate for the year of income, multiplied by the excess profit of the covered persons.\"\n- paragraph: \"(4) This section shall not apply\u2014\"\n- paragraph: \"(a) to a public entity that is not engaged in business;\"\n- paragraph: \"(b) to a person whose income is exempt from tax under paragraph 10 of the First Schedule;\"\n- paragraph: \"(c) to a pension fund and the assets of that pension fund;\"\n- paragraph: \"(d) to a real estate investment vehicle that is an ultimate parent entity;\"\n- paragraph: \"(e) to a non-operating investment holding company;\"\n- paragraph: \"(f) to an investment fund that is an ultimate parent entity;\"\n\n2. Continuations from previous page:\n- The first paragraph \"(6)\" continues from section 2.6.6.3 (Significant economic presence tax) from the previous page, as it appears to be subsection (6) of section 12E.\n\n3. Annotation References:\n- \"Insertion of new sections 12G and 12H of Cap. 470.\" references the heading about amending the Income Tax Act\n- \"Minimum top-up tax.\" references the new section 12G being introduced\n\n4. Section Continuation:\nThe previous page ended with section 2.6.6 (Amendment of section 12E of Income Tax Act). The first paragraph on this page (subsection 6) is the final part of section 12E, after which a new amendment (section 6) begins introducing sections 12G and 12H.\n\nThe continuing section from previous page is:\nid=\"2.6.6.3\" (Significant economic presence tax)\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe page continues two sections from the previous page:\n- Main content section (id=\"6\") continues from previous page\n- Footer section (id=\"7\") continues from previous page with the QR code\n\nKey Observations:\n- The page maintains the same document structure as the previous page\n- The content discusses legal proceedings regarding evidence admission\n- The page contains both numbered paragraphs and lettered list items\n- The QR code at the bottom serves as a consistent footer element\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Continuations from Previous Page:\n- Paragraph (9.1.e) continues from section 2.3.2 on previous page, specifically continuing the list that started with 9.1.a through 9.1.d\n\n3.

Section Continuation Analysis:\n- Section 2.3.2 \"Administrative Divisions of the Ministry Headquarters\" continues from the previous page\n- The page number (5) indicates this is page 5 of the document\n\nThe document structure shows a clear continuation of the legislative format with numbered sections and subsections, maintaining consistent hierarchy throughout.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe current page continues from the previous page's Part II section (id=\"2.2\"). The content on this page is still under \"Part II - THE FOREIGN SERVICE\" and represents sections 5 and 6 within that part.\n\nThe previous page ended with Section 4 (id=\"2.2.2\"), and this page continues Part II with new sections 5 and 6, maintaining the hierarchical structure under Part II (id=\"2.2\").\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

The coercion may also be inferred from the fact that the victim did not consent to her taking. The fact that the victim may have initially consented to some conduct does not necessarily prevent the establishment of the lack of consent element if his or her mind changes. That is essential to note, similarly, if the victim initially consented but now wants to leave and is prohibited, that can be considered kidnapping.\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"4.6.3.3\" layout_ids=\"3\">\n      In this case, it was the evidence of PW2 that at the time the child was taken, she had asked to go play with one of her friends. That the friend who was playing with Nabukenya Favor later informed her that she had been taken by a tall woman who had promised to buy her ice cream and sweets. It is with no doubt that this offer for ice cream and sweets enticed the victim to go with her alleged kidnappers without knowing that she was being kidnapped. Considering that this a minor who was innocent, gullible she could therefore have been easily taken advantage of.

Continuations from previous page:\n- The first paragraph is a continuation from paragraph id=\"4.6.3.3\" from the previous page, as it completes the sentence about \"one who was not in position to make decisions on her own\"\n\n3. Footnotes/Annotations:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n4. Section Continuation:\n- The current page continues section id=\"4.6.3\" (\"Evidence of Force, Fraud, or Coercion\") from the previous page for the first paragraph\n- Then a new section begins with \"Intention of gaining a ransom or reward\"\n\nKey observations:\n- The page contains a mix of continuing and new content\n- There are clear section breaks with bold headings\n- The page is numbered as page 4\n- There are line numbers (80, 90) visible in the margin\n- The content follows a logical legal argument structure analyzing elements of kidnapping\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuations from Previous Page:\n- The list items f, g, and h continue from the previous page's list that ended with item e. (from section 6.13)\n- The QR code image continues from the previous page's footer section (id=\"7.1\")\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation References:\n- No standalone footnotes or annotations identified on this page\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The main section from previous page (id=\"6\" type=\"main-content\" title=\"Application\") continues\n- The subsection from previous page (id=\"6.13\" type=\"subsection\" title=\"Court's Analysis\") continues\n- The footer section from previous page (id=\"7\" type=\"footer\") continues with the QR code\n\nThe page continues the hierarchical structure from page 3, maintaining the same section and subsection organization. The content primarily consists of continuing list items and paragraphs that form part of the Court's analysis of the application for additional evidence. The QR code at the bottom is part of the continuing footer section.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuations from Previous Page:\nThe content appears to be a direct continuation of section 4.6.5 \"The accused participated in commission of the act\" from the previous page.\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe current page continues section 4.6.5 from the previous page, which had the following attributes:\n- id=\"4.6.5\"\n- type=\"evidence_analysis\"\n- title=\"The accused participated in commission of the act\"\n- reference_id=\"4.5.5\"\n\nThe content on this page is clearly continuing the analysis of the accused's participation in the crime, following directly from the defense testimony discussed at the end of the previous page.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Split Elements:\nNo paragraphs appear to be split across multiple layout objects in an unnatural way. Each layout object represents a complete semantic unit.\n\n3. Leaf Node Elements:\nParagraphs:\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"0\" (What is clear from the defense testimony...)\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"1\" (It also evident from the testimony...)\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"2\" (Section 9 (1) of the Penal Code Act...)\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"3\" (A person who does or omits...)\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4\" (Erick Nkoyoyo took advantage...)\n\n4. Page Analysis:\na. Continuations:\n- This page continues section 4.6.5 from the previous page\n- The section maintains its attributes:\n  - id=\"4.6.5\"\n  - type=\"evidence_analysis\"\n  - title=\"The accused participated in commission of the act\"\n  - reference_id=\"4.5.5\"\n\nCurrent Page: 6 (visible at bottom of page)\n\n5. Section Analysis:\n- This page contains only a continuation of section 4.6.5\n- No new sections are introduced\n- The section is part of the evidence analysis hierarchy under section 4.6\n\n6. XML Structure Plan:\n\na) Hierarchical ID Structure:\n- Continue section 4.6.5\n- Paragraphs will be numbered sequentially continuing from previous page (4.6.5.8, 4.6.5.9, etc.)\n\nb) Sample XML Structure:\n\n<page number=\"6\">\n  <section id=\"4.6.5\" type=\"evidence_analysis\" \n          title=\"The accused participated in commission of the act\"\n          reference_id=\"4.5.5\"\n          continuedFrom=\"4.6.5\">\n    <!-- Paragraphs will go here -->\n  </section>\n</page>\n\nThe paragraphs will maintain sequential numbering from the previous page, which ended at 4.6.5.7. Therefore:\n- First paragraph will be id=\"4.6.5.8\"\n- Second paragraph will be id=\"4.6.5.9\"\n- Third paragraph will be id=\"4.6.5.10\"\n- Fourth paragraph (legal quote) will be id=\"4.6.5.11\"\n- Fifth paragraph will be id=\"4.6.5.12\"\n\nSpecial Considerations:\n1. The quoted text from Section 9(1) of the Penal Code Act should be treated as a regular paragraph but with appropriate formatting/styling to indicate it's a legal citation.\n2. The content flows naturally as part of the evidence analysis regarding the accused's participation in the crime.\n3. The page maintains the logical flow and hierarchy established in the previous pages.\n</document_analysis>"

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

There was no evidence to show that the telephone number that has consistently been calling to ask for the ransom belonged to either A1 or A2. A1 unknowingly took in the victim on the request of Eric Nkoyoyo. Her actions were honest in the sense there was no way she would know that victim had been kidnapped. It can be said that there was no motive on her part as indicated in her charge and caution statement.

Structural Decisions:\n- Maintained the continuation of section 4.6.5 from the previous page\n- Kept sequential paragraph numbering (4.6.5.8 through 4.6.5.12)\n- Treated the legal citation (Section 9(1)) as two separate paragraphs:\n  a) The introduction (4.6.5.10)\n  b) The quoted text itself (4.6.5.11)\n  This makes it easier to style and reference separately while maintaining the document's structure\n\n3. Attribute Handling:\n- Maintained all attributes from the previous page's section (title, toc, reference_id)\n- Added continuedFrom attribute to show connection to previous page\n- Included layout_ids for all paragraphs based on OCR layout information\n\n4. Content Structure:\n- Preserved the logical flow of the legal argument\n- Maintained the hierarchical structure established in previous pages\n- Ensured proper XML escaping of special characters\n\n5. Page Numbering:\n- Included page number=\"6\" based on visible page number at bottom of page\n\nNo significant ambiguities were encountered in the instructions for this page, as the content followed a clear continuation pattern from the previous page.\n</decision_log>"

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- Paragraph (a) about individual insurance premium payments\n- Paragraph (b) about employer insurance premium payments  \n- Paragraph (c) about joint premium payments\n- Paragraph about entitlement to personal relief\n- Text \"Provided that\u2014\"\n- Paragraph (v) about health policy qualification\n- Heading \"The First Schedule to Cap. 470 which it is intended to amend\u2014\"\n- Paragraph 53 about monthly pension\n- Paragraph 57 about National Housing Development Fund\n- Paragraph 58 about Ajira Digital Program income\n- Text \"Provided that\u2014\"\n- Paragraph (a) about exemption qualification\n- Paragraph (b) about Cabinet Secretary regulations\n- Paragraph 60 about interest income from green bonds\n\n2. Continuations from Previous Page:\nThe opening paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are direct continuations from Section 31 \"Insurance Relief\" (id=\"3.12.2\") from the previous page, which ended with the incomplete paragraph \"(1) A resident individual who proves that in a year of income\u2014\"\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present in this page.\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe current page continues Section 31 of Cap. 470 (id=\"3.12\") from the previous page, specifically continuing the subsection about Insurance Relief (id=\"3.12.2\"). The opening paragraphs are completing the conditions started in paragraph 3.12.2.2 from the previous page.\n\nThe document structure then transitions to a new section about \"The First Schedule to Cap. 470\" after completing the insurance relief section.\n\nKey Observations:\n- The page number is 1041\n- The page maintains the same document title header\n- There's a clear transition from continuing the previous section about insurance relief to introducing new content about The First Schedule\n- The content is organized in a hierarchical structure with main sections and subsections\n- Multiple numbered paragraphs (53, 57, 58, 60) appear to be part of The First Schedule amendments\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Structure Decisions:\n- Created a hierarchical structure maintaining continuation from previous page for Section 31\n- Organized the First Schedule amendments as a new major section (3.13)\n- Created a dedicated subsection for Ajira Digital Program content due to its related provisions\n\n2. OCR Corrections:\n- Removed duplicate \"individual\" instances in paragraph 3.12.2.3\n- Corrected \"iS\" to \"is\" in insurance company text\n- Fixed spacing and formatting issues throughout\n- Removed \"nun\" OCR error from Ajira Program text\n\n3. Content Organization:\n- Combined \"Provided that\u2014\" with its associated content in paragraphs\n- Maintained reference_ids for numbered items and lettered paragraphs\n- Structured the Ajira Digital Program provisions as a subsection due to its multiple related paragraphs\n\n4. Ambiguities/Improvements:\n- The relationship between the First Schedule amendments could potentially be structured with more granular subsections\n- The distinction between regular paragraphs and provisions marked with \"Provided that\u2014\" could be more explicitly represented in the structure\n- The reference_id system could be enhanced to better represent the hierarchical nature of legal provisions\n\n5. Assumptions:\n- Assumed continuation of section numbering from previous page\n- Treated numbered items (53, 57, 58, 60) as separate paragraphs within the First Schedule section\n- Assumed the Ajira Digital Program provisions warranted their own subsection due to related content\n</decision_log>"

Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The page continues from section 3.3.6 (Wife's Employment Income definition) from the previous page\n- After completing that definition, several new definitions are introduced\n- Then new major sections begin with \"Section 3 of Cap. 470\" and \"Section 5 of Cap. 470\"\n\nThe page shows a clear continuation of the definitions section from the previous page, completing the \"wife's employment income\" definition before introducing new definitions and sections. The hierarchical structure transitions from completing previous definitions to introducing new sections of the bill.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

The paper and many follow-up research generally consider the Transfer Learning setup where the dense retriever is first learned using a diverse and richly supervised corpus and query collection, namely MS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022).\n    </paragraph>\n    <paragraph id=\"4.4.3\" layout_ids=\"2\">\n        However, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such a large collection can rarely be assumed. In this paper, therefore, we study the problem of building effective dense retrieval systems without relevance labels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also do not assume access to the test time corpora for training. This is a more realistic setup and prevents over-engineering on the test corpora.\n    </paragraph>\n    <paragraph id=\"4.4.4\" layout_ids=\"3\">\n        By the definition in Sachan et al.

These models use (constrained) decoding to generate document identifiers, such as id and sub-string, which map directly to real documents. They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our method uses the standard MIPS index and requires no training or training data.

Document Analysis:\nThe current page continues from the previous page, containing mathematical formulas, implementation details, and dataset descriptions. The content is primarily technical in nature, discussing the HyDE methodology and experimental setup.\n\n2. Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- Paragraph (continuing from 5.4.8) about writing paragraphs and sample instructions\n- Mathematical equation (5)\n- Paragraph about formal probability distribution\n- Mathematical equation (6)\n- Mathematical equation (7)\n- Paragraph about query consideration\n- Mathematical equation (8)\n- Paragraph about inner product computation\n- Heading \"4 Experiments\"\n- Heading \"4.1 Setup\"\n- Paragraph about Implementation\n- Heading \"4.2 Web Search\"\n- Paragraph about datasets\n- Paragraph about Compared Systems\n- Paragraph about web search results\n\n3. Continuations from Previous Page:\n- The opening paragraph is a continuation of paragraph id=\"5.4.8\" from the previous page, which was cut off mid-sentence with \"Now we can use g to map queries to \"hypothetical\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST\"\n\n4. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n5. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The page continues section id=\"5.4\" (titled \"3.2 HyDE\") from the previous page\n- The section continues until the new section \"4 Experiments\" begins\n\nThe page shows a natural progression from the methodology description into the experimental setup, with several mathematical equations integrated into the text. The content flows logically from the theoretical framework established on the previous page into the practical implementation and experimental details.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

We estimate Equation 5 by sampling N documents from g, [d1, d2, ..., dN].\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"5.4.11\" layout_ids=\"4,5,6\">\n        vqij = 1/N \u03a3 f(dk) (6)\n              dk~g(qij,INSTi)\n        \n        = 1/N \u03a3N k=1 f(dk) (7)\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"5.4.12\" layout_ids=\"7,8\">\n        We also consider the query as a possible hypothesis,\n        \n        vqij = 1/(N+1)[\u03a3N k=1 f(dk) + f(qij)] (8)\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"5.4.13\" layout_ids=\"9\">\n        Inner product is computed between vqij and the set of all document vectors {f(d)|d \u2208 Di}. The most similar documents are retrieved. Here the encoder function f serves as a lossy compressor that outputs dense vectors, where the extra details are filtered and left out from the vector. It further grounds the hypothetical vector to the actual corpus and the real documents. The full HyDE system is illustrated in Figure 1.\n    </paragraph>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"6\" type=\"section\" title=\"4 Experiments\" reference_id=\"4\" toc=\"4 Experiments\">\n    <heading id=\"6.1\" layout_ids=\"10\">4 Experiments</heading>\n    \n    <section id=\"6.2\" type=\"subsection\" title=\"4.1 Setup\" reference_id=\"4.1\">\n        <heading id=\"6.2.1\" layout_ids=\"11\">4.1 Setup</heading>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.2.2\" layout_ids=\"12,13\">\n            Implementation We implement HyDE using InstructGPT, a GPT-3 model from the instruct series (text-davinci-003; Ouyang et al. (2022)) and Contriever models (Izacard et al., 2021). We sample from InstructGPT using the OpenAI playground default temperature of 0.7 for open-ended generations. We use the English-only Contriever model for English retrieval tasks and multilingual mContriever for non-English tasks. We conducted retrieval experiments with the Pyserini toolkit (Lin et al., 2021a).\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.2.3\" layout_ids=\"14\">\n            Datasets We consider web search query sets TREC DL19 (Craswell et al., 2020a) and DL20 (Craswell et al., 2020b); they are based on the MS-MARCO dataset (Bajaj et al., 2016). We also use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource datasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al., 2021). For non-English retrieval, we consider Swahili, Korean, Japanese, and Bengali from the Mr.Tydi dataset (Zhang et al., 2021).\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.2.4\" layout_ids=\"15\">\n            We use different instructions for each dataset. They share a similar structure but have different quantifiers to control the exact form of the generated hypothetical documents. These instructions can be found in subsection A.1.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.2.5\" layout_ids=\"16,17\">\n            Compared Systems Contriever models, Contriever and mContriever, serve as our major baseline. They are trained using unsupervised contrastive learning. HyDE retrievers share the exact same embedding spaces with them. The only difference is how the query vector is built. These comparisons allow us to easily examine the effect of HyDE. The classical heuristic-based lexical retriever BM25 is also included.\n            \n            Several systems that involve fine-tuning on massive relevance data are also included as references. We consider models fine-tuned on MS-MARCO and transferred, DPR and ANCE, from the BEIR paper. For multilingual, we include the mDPR model from Mr.Tydi paper and MS-MARCO fine-tuned mBERT and XLM-R from the Contriever paper. We also include the state-of-the-art transfer learning models: Contriever and mContriever fine-tuned on MS-MARCO, denoted ContrieverFT and mContrieverFT. These models have run through the state-of-the-art retrieval model training pipeline that involves second-stage retrieval-specific pre-training (Lee et al., 2019) and a few rounds of fine-tuning (Qu et al., 2021); they should be considered empirical upper bounds.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"6.3\" type=\"subsection\" title=\"4.2 Web Search\" reference_id=\"4.2\">\n        <heading id=\"6.3.1\" layout_ids=\"18\">4.2 Web Search</heading>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.3.2\" layout_ids=\"19\">\n            In Table 1, we show retrieval results on TREC DL19 and TREC DL20.

Structural Decisions:\n- Maintained the continuation of section 5.4 from previous page\n- Started new section 6 for \"4 Experiments\" with appropriate subsections\n- Used hierarchical IDs that reflect the document structure (5.4.x, 6.x, etc.)\n\n2. OCR Corrections:\n- Corrected \"INST()\" to \"INSTi\" in equation (5)\n- Fixed mathematical notation in equations (6), (7), and (8)\n- Corrected \"fine-1 -tuned\" to \"fine-tuned\"\n- Fixed \"non-Englishs\" to \"non-English\"\n\n3. Content Organization:\n- Grouped mathematical equations with their surrounding explanatory text in the same paragraphs\n- Combined split paragraphs that were clearly part of the same semantic unit\n- Maintained proper continuation of formulas and technical content\n\n4. Ambiguities and Challenges:\n- Mathematical formulas required careful handling to preserve their meaning while fixing OCR errors\n- Some layout objects contained overlapping or duplicate content that needed to be deduplicated\n- The transition between sections required careful attention to maintain proper hierarchy\n\n5. Reference Handling:\n- Added appropriate reference_id attributes for sections and subsections\n- Included toc attribute for the main section that would appear in the table of contents\n\n6.

Continuations from previous page:\nThe current page continues Section 2 (Interpretation) from the previous page, with additional definition paragraphs. The section ID from previous page is \"2.1.2\".\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation References:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n4. Continuing Section Analysis:\nThe page begins by continuing section 2.1.2 (Interpretation) from the previous page, containing additional definitions. This continues until the start of Part II. The previous section's ID was \"2.1.2\".\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

The references continue in the same format and style as the previous page.\n\nKey observations:\n- The page contains only reference entries\n- The first entry completes the truncated reference from the previous page\n- All content belongs to the existing References section\n- The formatting and style remain consistent with the previous page's references\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- Table continuation from previous page (3 more rows):\n  * Row 1: Float glass description and rate\n  * Row 2: Ceramic flags/tiles description and rate  \n  * Row 3: Coal description and rate\n- Paragraph (H) about imported sugar confectionary\n- Paragraph (I) introducing new descriptions\n- Table with 3 rows of tariff codes and rates\n- Paragraph (J) about wines and alcoholic beverages\n- Paragraph (K) about beer and fermented beverages (appears incomplete)\n\n2. Continuations from Previous Page:\n- The table from section 2.15.3.2.8.2 continues onto this page with 3 more rows\n- The table was part of amendment (G) which introduced new items and rates\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- This page continues section 2.15.3.2.8 \"New Items and Excise Duty Rates\" from the previous page\n- The table completes the items introduced by amendment (G)\n- New amendments (H), (I), (J), and (K) are part of the same parent section 2.15.3.2 \"Amendments to Second Table of Paragraph 1\"\n\nThe page shows a clear continuation of the legislative amendments, maintaining the same hierarchical structure and amendment pattern from the previous page. The content flows naturally from the previous amendments and continues with new items while maintaining consistent formatting and numbering.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Structural Decisions:\n- Maintained the hierarchical structure from previous page (2.15.3.2)\n- Created new amendment sections for each lettered amendment (H through K)\n- Added meaningful titles for each amendment section based on their content\n\n2. OCR Corrections:\n- Standardized \"Shs.\" vs \"shs.\" to \"Shs.\" throughout\n- Corrected spacing and formatting in tariff codes\n- Fixed \"centilitre\" spelling\n- Standardized punctuation and spacing in rates and descriptions\n\n3. Content Handling:\n- Amendment K appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence. Left it as-is since it continues on next page\n- Structured the tariff tables with proper headers and rows\n- Preserved reference IDs using letter designations (H, I, J, K)\n\n4. Ambiguities:\n- The layout of the tables in the original document made it somewhat unclear where table boundaries were\n- Some rates had inconsistent formatting (with/without spaces, different currency notations)\n- The relationship between the tariff codes and their descriptions required careful parsing\n\n5. Improvements:\n- Could benefit from additional attributes to indicate currency types\n- Might be useful to add validation for tariff codes\n- Could add cross-references between related amendments\n</decision_log>"

Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Leaf Node Analysis (in reading order):\n- Heading: \"The Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024\" (page number 1045)\n- Paragraph: Item 91 about specially designed locally assembled motor vehicles\n- Paragraph: Condition (i) about vehicle registration\n- Paragraph: Condition (ii) about exclusive use for tourists\n- Paragraph: Condition (iii) about vehicle provisions\n- Paragraph: Condition (iv) about Commissioner conditions\n- Paragraph: Proviso about tax becoming payable\n- Paragraph: Item 114 about taxable goods supplied to persons\n- Paragraph: Proviso about exemption applying to unexpired period\n- Paragraph: Item 146 about capital goods exemption\n- Paragraph: Proviso about value of investment\n- Paragraph: Item 147 about taxable supplies for school feeding\n- Heading: \"PART II - SERVICES\"\n- Paragraph: Item 17 about betting and gaming services\n- Paragraph: Item 18 about hiring and leasing aircraft\n- Paragraph: Item 19 about air ticketing services\n- Paragraph: Item 24 about entry fees to national parks\n- Paragraph: Item 25 about tour operator services\n\n2. Continuations from Previous Page:\nThe content continues from section 3.19.2.2.2 (Section A of Part I - Goods) from the previous page, as this page contains additional items in the same list of exempt supplies.\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\nThis page continues section 3.19.2.2.2 from the previous page, which was \"Section A\" under \"Part I - Goods\" of the \"Exempt Supplies\" section. The page then transitions to \"Part II - Services\" which is a new section at the same level as Part I.\n\nThe hierarchical structure continues from:\n<section id=\"3.19.2.2.2\" type=\"section\" title=\"Section A\">\n\nThis page maintains the same document structure but transitions from Part I to Part II of the exempt supplies listing.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes.

Paragraph - Discussion of precision metrics\n6. Paragraph - Discussion of HyDE vs fine-tuned models\n7. Heading - Section 4.3\n8. Paragraph - Analysis of low resource results\n\n3. Continuations from Previous Page:\nThe first paragraph (discussing precision metrics) is a continuation from section 4.2 Web Search (id=\"6.3.2\") from the previous page, which ended mid-sentence with \"In Table 1, we show retrieval results on TREC DL19 and TREC DL20. We see HyDE bring sizable improvements to Contriever across the board for\"\n\n4. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n5. Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe page continues section 4.2 Web Search (id=\"6.3\") from the previous page, containing the completion of the discussion about web search results before transitioning to section 4.3. The continuation includes the tables and analysis that were referenced in the previous page's incomplete paragraph.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

On TREC DL19, HyDE shows comparable map and ndcg@10 to ContrieverFT and best recall@1k. On DL20, HyDE gets around 10% lower map and ndcg@10 than ContrieverFT and similar recall@1k.

Similar to web search, HyDE again brings sizable improvements to Contriever across the board in terms of both ndcg and recall.

HyDE generally shows better performance than ANCE and DPR, even though the two are fine-tuned on MS-MARCO and ANCE also involves some sophisticated hard negative techniques. ContrieverFT shows performance advantages on FiQA and DBPedia. These involve retrieval of financial posts or entities respectively.

Structure Decisions:\n- Maintained section 6.3's continuation from previous page with same ID\n- Created new section 6.4 for \"4.3 Low Resource Retrieval\"\n- Kept tables within their respective sections for context\n\n2. Content Corrections:\n- Fixed spacing in \"fine-tuned\" where it appeared as \"fine -tuned\"\n- Removed duplicate \"f fi-\" artifact in financial\n- Standardized spacing around \"@\" symbols in metrics\n\n3. Table Handling:\n- Created structured table representations with headers and rows\n- Preserved numerical data precisely as shown\n- Included both tables within section 6.3 as they relate to web search discussion\n\n4. Continuity:\n- Last paragraph of section 6.4 ends mid-sentence, indicating continuation on next page\n- Maintained hierarchical structure from previous page\n\n5. Ambiguities:\n- Table structure could potentially be enhanced with additional attributes for metrics\n- Could consider splitting tables into separate sections, but kept within main sections for context\n- Some numerical data in tables could benefit from additional type attributes to distinguish metrics\n\n6.

Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Analyzing the inputs:\nThe current page appears to be page 4 of the document, continuing from page 3. It contains several sections including continuations from previous sections, struck-through text, and new chapters on Successors and Assigns, Further Assurance, and Data Protection.\n\n2. Leaf nodes in reading order:\n1. Paragraph (continuation) - content about accessing content for providing services\n2. Paragraph (struck through) - [6.3] about insolvency/bankruptcy\n3. Heading - \"7 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS\"\n4. Paragraph - 7.1 about binding agreement\n5. Paragraph - 7.2 about transfer restrictions\n6. Paragraph - 7.2.1 about written approval\n7. Paragraph - 7.2.2 about transferee obligations\n8. Heading - \"8 Further Assurance Clause\"\n9. Paragraph - [7.1] about executing further documents (with struck-through text)\n10. Heading - \"9[8] DATA PROTECTION\"\n11. Paragraph - 9.1[8.1] about privacy protection\n12. Paragraph - [8.2] about data handling\n\n3. Continuations from previous page:\n- The first paragraph continues from section 8.3.1 (id=\"8.3.1\") on the previous page, which was discussing User Content Rights\n\n4. Footnote/Annotation analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n5. Continuing section from previous page:\n- The page begins by continuing section 8.3 (id=\"8.3\") from the previous page, which was discussing User Content Rights\n- After completing this continuation, the document moves on to new sections\n\nThe page shows evidence of revision/editing with struck-through text and some section number adjustments (e.g., \"9[8]\" suggesting a renumbering from 8 to 9).\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes.

Numbering Decisions:\n- Used clean numbers (9 instead of 9[8]) for DATA PROTECTION section, as bracketed numbers appear to be previous revision markers\n- Similarly cleaned up section reference numbers (7.1 instead of [7.1]) throughout\n\n4. Ambiguities:\n- Some sections show evidence of renumbering (e.g., \"9[8]\", \"[7.1]\") - chose to use the non-bracketed numbers as they appear to be the final intended numbers\n- The reference_id for section 11.3 uses \"8.2\" based on the original text marker, though it appears within chapter 9\n\n5.

Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- Section 2.3.2 \"Administrative Divisions of the Ministry Headquarters\" continues from the previous page\n- The page number (5) indicates this is page 5 of the document\n\nThe document structure shows a clear continuation of the legislative format with numbered sections and subsections, maintaining consistent hierarchy throughout.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuation Analysis:\nThe paragraphs labeled b, c, d, and e are direct continuations of the list that started in section 6 on the previous page, specifically continuing from paragraph 6.4 which had item \"a.\"\nThe paragraph labeled \"iii\" is continuing the numbered list that started with \"i\" and \"ii\" in section 6.\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\nThis page continues Section 6 (\"main-content\" with title \"Application\") from the previous page. The section's id on the previous page was \"6\". All content on this page (except the footer image) belongs to this continuing section.\n\nKey Observations:\n- The page maintains the same hierarchical structure from the previous page\n- The content follows a logical sequence of numbered and lettered paragraphs\n- The page ends with a footer section containing a QR code, similar to the previous page\n- The numbering scheme (2. and 3.) suggests these are main paragraphs in the continuing section\n- The lettered items (b through e) are sub-items continuing from item \"a\" on the previous page\n\nThe structure shows this is page 2 of the document, as indicated by the page number at the bottom.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- Paragraph (continuation): pension scheme or National Social Security Fund from income tax...\n- Paragraph: It also proposes to delete paragraph 60...\n- Paragraph: Additionally, by deleting paragraph 71...\n- Paragraph: Clause 15 of the Bill is intended to amend...\n- Paragraph: Clause 16 of the Bill is intended to amend...\n- Paragraph: Clause 17 of the Bill is intended to amend...\n- Paragraph: Clause 18 of the Bill is intended to amend...\n- Paragraph: Clause 19 of the Bill is intended to amend...\n\n2. Continuations from previous page:\n- The first paragraph is a continuation of paragraph id=\"2.17.3.14.1\" from the previous page, which was cut off mid-sentence at \"...pension fund, registered provident fund, public\"\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation References:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The current page continues section 2.17.3.14 \"Clause 14 - Pension Payment Exemptions\" from the previous page\n- After that continuation completes, new sections begin for Clauses 15-19\n\n5. Additional Structure Analysis:\n- The page is part of the same parent section 2.17.3 \"Clause Descriptions\"\n- Each new clause (15-19) represents a new subsection at the same level as the previous clauses\n- The page number is 1034\n- The document title \"The Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024\" is visible at the top of the page\n\nThe page continues the hierarchical structure from the previous page, maintaining the same section numbering pattern and formatting for clause descriptions. Each new clause introduces a distinct subsection within the main \"Clause Descriptions\" section.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

The title attribute was missing from sections even though they had toc=\"true\"\n2. The main section 2.17.3 should have \"Clause Descriptions\" as its title\n3. Some titles could be more concise and consistent with the document style\n4. The first paragraph under 2.17.3.14 should be split into multiple paragraphs based on content breaks\n5. Reference_id attributes could be more consistently applied\n\nHere's the corrected XML:\n\n\n\n<decision_log>\n1. Content Changes:\n- Split paragraph 2.17.3.14.1 into two separate paragraphs based on natural content breaks\n- Updated section titles to be more specific and consistent with document style\n- Maintained all previous OCR corrections\n\n2. Structural Improvements:\n- Added title attributes to all sections with toc=\"true\"\n- Made section titles more descriptive and specific to their content\n- Ensured consistent use of reference_id attributes for all clause sections\n\n3. Title Formatting Decisions:\n- Used consistent format for clause titles: \"Clause X - [Topic]\"\n- Made titles more specific to reflect actual content rather than general descriptions\n- Abbreviated \"East African Community\" to \"EAC\" in section 2.17.3.19 title for brevity\n\n4. Hierarchy Maintenance:\n- Maintained consistent section and paragraph numbering\n- Preserved continuation markers from previous page\n- Ensured proper nesting of all elements\n\n5. Notes:\n- All sections are marked as toc=\"true\" as they represent significant structural elements that would be useful in a table of contents\n- Paragraph 2.17.3.19.1 still appears to continue on the next page\n</decision_log>"

Your task is to process multi-page documents, converting them from image and OCR data into a structured XML format while maintaining the document's hierarchical structure.\n\nHere are the inputs you'll be working with:\n\n1. Previous Page (may be empty):\n<previous_page>\n\n</previous_page>\n\n2. Current Page:\nThis has been provided as the image\n\n3. Table of Contents so far (with ids and sample text):\n<table_of_contents_so_far>\n\n</table_of_contents_so_far>\n\n4. OCR and Layout Information:\n<ocr_layout_info>\n[]\n</ocr_layout_info>\n\n5. Page Analysis:\n<page_analysis>\n1. Leaf Node Analysis (in reading order):\n- Heading: \"Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels\"\n- Annotation: Author affiliations marked with \u2020 and \u2021\n- Annotation: Email addresses for authors\n- Heading: \"Abstract\" \n- Paragraph: Abstract text starting with \"While dense retrieval has been shown effective...\"\n- Heading: \"1 Introduction\"\n- Paragraph: Introduction text starting with \"Dense retrieval (Lee et al., 2019...\"\n- Annotation: Footnote marked with * stating \"Equal contribution\"\n- Annotation: Footnote marked with 1 about model training and code availability\n\n2. Continuation Analysis:\n- No previous page content exists, so there are no continuations to analyze\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation References:\n- The \u2020 and \u2021 annotations reference the author names in the title block\n- The email addresses annotation references the author names\n- The * footnote \"Equal contribution\" references the authors marked with *\n- The footnote 1 references content within the main text discussing models\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- No previous page exists, so there is no section continuation to analyze\n\nAdditional Observations:\n- The page represents the start of an academic paper with a clear hierarchical structure\n- The Introduction section continues beyond this page\n- There are multiple types of annotations - superscript markers (\u2020,\u2021,*,1) and institutional affiliations\n- The document contains extensive citations and references to other works\n- The layout follows a typical academic paper format with title, authors, abstract, and introduction\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect details. Our experiments show that HyDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong performance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers, across various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact verification) and languages (e.g. sw, ko, ja).\n    </paragraph>\n    <annotation id=\"2.3\" for=\"2.2\" layout_ids=\"7\">\n        No models were trained or fine-tuned in making this preprint.

A variety of methods such as negative mining (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021b; Hofst\u00e4tter et al., 2021) and task-specific pre-training (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022; Liu and Shao, 2022) have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of supervised dense retrieval models.\n\n        On the other hand, zero-shot dense retrieval still remains difficult. Many recent works consider the alternative transfer learning setup, where the dense retrievers are trained on high-resource dataset and then evaluated on queries from new tasks. The MS-MARCO collection (Bajaj et al., 2016), a massive judged dataset with a large number of judged query-document pairs, is arguably the most commonly used. As argued by Izacard et al. (2021), in practice, however, the existence of such large dataset cannot always be assumed. Even MS-MARCO restricts commercial use and cannot be adopted in a variety of real-world search scenarios.\n\n        In this paper, we aim to build effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision, work out-of-box and generalize across tasks. As supervision is not available, we start by examining self-supervised representation learning methods. Modern deep learning enables two distinct learning algorithms. At the token level, generative large language models (LLM) pre-trained on large corpus have demonstrated strong natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). At the document level, text (chunk) encoders pre-trained with contrastive objectives learn to encode document-document similarity into inner-product (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022). On top of these, one extra insight into LLM is borrowed: the LLMs further trained to follow instructions can zero-shot generalize to diverse unseen instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

Section Continuation Analysis:\nThe current page continues section 4.6.5 \"Evidence of Accused Participation\" from the previous page. This section (4.6.5) had only its heading on the previous page and continues here with its content.\n\nKey Observations:\n- The page is numbered as page 5\n- The content is entirely within section 4.6.5\n- The text discusses evidence related to the accused's participation in the kidnapping\n- There are two highlighted portions of text that appear to be emphasized\n- The page maintains the same formatting and structure as the previous page\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuations from previous page:\n- The first paragraph \"twenty percent\" continues from paragraph id=\"2.15.3.3.1\" on the previous page, which ended with \"in Part II\u2014 (i) in paragraph 1, by deleting the words \"fifteen percent\" and substituting therefor the words\"\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation References:\n- The annotation \"Amendment of section 8 of Cap. 469C.\" references the section starting with \"26. Section 8 of the Miscellaneous Fees and Levies\"\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- Section id=\"2.15.3.3\" (\"Amendments to Part II\") from the previous page continues on this page, containing the amendments to paragraphs 1, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 8.\n- A new main section begins with \"26. Section 8 of the Miscellaneous Fees and Levies\"\n\nThe page shows a clear structure with continuing amendments from the previous section followed by a new section regarding Miscellaneous Fees and Levies.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

(2021) for the neural retrieval community. Their BEIR benchmark consists of diverse retrieval tasks. The paper and many follow-up research generally consider the Transfer Learning setup where the dense retriever is first learned using a diverse and richly supervised corpus and query collection, namely MS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022).\n    </paragraph>\n    <paragraph id=\"4.4.3\" layout_ids=\"2\">\n        However, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such a large collection can rarely be assumed. In this paper, therefore, we study the problem of building effective dense retrieval systems without relevance labels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also do not assume access to the test time corpora for training. This is a more realistic setup and prevents over-engineering on the test corpora.\n    </paragraph>\n    <paragraph id=\"4.4.4\" layout_ids=\"3\">\n        By the definition in Sachan et al.

These models use (constrained) decoding to generate document identifiers, such as id and sub-string, which map directly to real documents. They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our method uses the standard MIPS index and requires no training or training data.

Leaf Node Elements (in reading order):\n- Paragraph (continuing from 5.4.8) about writing paragraphs and sample instructions\n- Mathematical equation (5)\n- Paragraph about formal probability distribution\n- Mathematical equation (6)\n- Mathematical equation (7)\n- Paragraph about query consideration\n- Mathematical equation (8)\n- Paragraph about inner product computation\n- Heading \"4 Experiments\"\n- Heading \"4.1 Setup\"\n- Paragraph about Implementation\n- Heading \"4.2 Web Search\"\n- Paragraph about datasets\n- Paragraph about Compared Systems\n- Paragraph about web search results\n\n3. Continuations from Previous Page:\n- The opening paragraph is a continuation of paragraph id=\"5.4.8\" from the previous page, which was cut off mid-sentence with \"Now we can use g to map queries to \"hypothetical\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST\"\n\n4. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page\n\n5. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The page continues section id=\"5.4\" (titled \"3.2 HyDE\") from the previous page\n- The section continues until the new section \"4 Experiments\" begins\n\nThe page shows a natural progression from the methodology description into the experimental setup, with several mathematical equations integrated into the text. The content flows logically from the theoretical framework established on the previous page into the practical implementation and experimental details.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

We use the English-only Contriever model for English retrieval tasks and multilingual mContriever for non-English tasks.

We also use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource datasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al., 2021). For non-English retrieval, we consider Swahili, Korean, Japanese, and Bengali from the Mr.Tydi dataset (Zhang et al., 2021).\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.2.4\" layout_ids=\"15\">\n            We use different instructions for each dataset.

We also include the state-of-the-art transfer learning models: Contriever and mContriever fine-tuned on MS-MARCO, denoted ContrieverFT and mContrieverFT. These models have run through the state-of-the-art retrieval model training pipeline that involves second-stage retrieval-specific pre-training (Lee et al., 2019) and a few rounds of fine-tuning (Qu et al., 2021); they should be considered empirical upper bounds.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"6.3\" type=\"subsection\" title=\"4.2 Web Search\" reference_id=\"4.2\">\n        <heading id=\"6.3.1\" layout_ids=\"18\">4.2 Web Search</heading>\n        \n        <paragraph id=\"6.3.2\" layout_ids=\"19\">\n            In Table 1, we show retrieval results on TREC DL19 and TREC DL20.

We estimate Equation 5 by sampling N documents from g, [d1, d2, ..., dN].\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <formula id=\"5.4.12\" layout_ids=\"4,5,6\">\n        vqij = 1/N \u03a3 f(dk) (6)\n              dk~g(qij,INSTi)\n        \n        = 1/N \u03a3N k=1 f(dk) (7)\n    </formula>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"5.4.13\" layout_ids=\"7\">\n        We also consider the query as a possible hypothesis,\n    </paragraph>\n    \n    <formula id=\"5.4.14\" layout_ids=\"8\">\n        vqij = 1/(N+1)[\u03a3N k=1 f(dk) + f(qij)] (8)\n    </formula>\n    \n    <paragraph id=\"5.4.15\" layout_ids=\"9\">\n        Inner product is computed between vqij and the set of all document vectors {f(d)|d \u2208 Di}.

It further grounds the hypothetical vector to the actual corpus and the real documents.

We also use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource datasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al., 2021).

It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuation Analysis:\n- The first paragraph is a continuation from section 2.2.2 (Key Points) from the previous page, specifically continuing from layout_ids=\"12\" as it completes the key implications point.\n\n3. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\n- No footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n4. Section Continuation Analysis:\n- The first line continues section 2.2.2 from the previous page (Key Points - Application No. 31/2024)\n- After that continuation, two new major sections begin:\n  1. Decision on Application No. 32/2024\n  2. Decision on Tender Dispute - Application No. 33/2024\n\nThe page continues the regulatory decisions section (id=\"2\") from the previous page, maintaining the same document hierarchy but introducing new subsections within it.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present. (type=\"cover page\")\n\nHere's an example of the eventual expected output structure:\n\n<page>\n  <section id=\"1\" type=\"chapter\" reference_id=\"1\">\n    <heading id=\"1.1\" layout_ids=\"1\">1.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."

Continuations from previous page:\nThe first three paragraphs continue from section 2.11.3 (Functions of Director-General) from the previous page, specifically continuing the list of responsibilities that started with (i) and (ii).\n\n4. Footnote/Annotation Analysis:\nNo footnotes or annotations present on this page.\n\n5. Continuing Section Analysis:\nSection 2.11.3 (Functions of Director-General) continues from the previous page, completing the list of responsibilities that began on page 11.\n</page_analysis>\n\n\nBefore generating the XML output, analyze these inputs and plan your approach. It's ok for your analysis to be quite long. Include the following:\n\n1. Identify and list potential OCR errors, missing elements and duplications, including the error and your proposed correction.\n2. Note if any paragraphs or other elements have been split across multiple layout objects. Where the text is clearly cut of and continues in a different layout object, these should become one paragraph element in the XML.\n3. Identify and list each leaf node element (paragraph, heading, annotation, table, image) present on the page. One list item per leaf node.\n   a. List each element identifed it by listing one or more ids from the OCR layout objects that make up the content of that single semantic element. Goup by element type. List in the following order: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, annotations. For example:\n- heading layout_ids=\"2\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"4,5\"\n- paragraph layout_ids=\"6\"\netc...\n4. Page analysis:\n  a. Note any continuations from the previous page (sections, paragraphs, tables, etc), if there is a previous page. If there are continuations, the generated ids will be the same as the last page and you will set the continuedFrom attribute. Otherwise, the id will be a natural continuation of the hierarchy ids.\n  c. Determine if the page number for the current page is visible on the page. If yes, output the current page number in the format Current Page: X (Or None).\n5. Perform an analysis for each new section (not a continuation)\n  - Refer to the table of contents and identify the correct sibling section and parent section.\n  - Determine the most appropriate id, given the natural hierarchy of the page and your pace in the table of contents so far.\n6. Plan the XML structure:\n   a) Describe how you'll represent hierarchy through hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1) for all elements. Consider the natural level of the section, taking into account visual information and semantics.\n   b) Create a detailed sample XML structure snippet for the full section hierarchy excluding the content of the sections (paragraphs, annotations, etc.), demonstrating how hierarchical IDs, continuedFrom, and continues attributes are used.\n\nHierarchy and Structural Rules:\n- Each <section> may have one <heading> as its direct child (if applicable), followed by <paragraph>, <table>, <image>, and/or <annotation> children.\n- You many only use the following elements: page, section, heading, annotation, paragraph, table, and image.\n- Sections may be nested inside other sections (reflected in the hierarchical ID).\n- Headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and annotations can only appear inside a <section>.\n- Hierarchical IDs must be unique across the entire document. The only scenarios where an ID can appear more than once is when an element continues across multiple pages. On the next page, the continuing element should have continuedFrom=\"<old_id>\" and reuse the same id (i.e. id=\"5\" continuedFrom=\"5\").\n- Hierarchical ids should not decrease.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Start and end the analysis step in <document_analysis> tags\n  - It's ok for your analysis to be quite long\n  - Picture objects will only have their first 20 characters extracted\n  - You may add a section for a cover page if one is present.

Generate well-structured XML using appropriate tags and nesting:\n  - Begin and end each your output with a <page> element.\n  - Use \"section\" tags for all section types, with a 'type' attribute to differentiate them.\n  - For section tags which should be included in a table of contents, set a 'toc' attribute to appropriate header text.\n  - Add a hierarchical 'id' attribute to EVERY element (e.g., 1, 1.1, 2.3.1). The number of '.'s represent the 'level' in the hierarchy.\n  - Ensure all elements are semantic and may span multiple columns or pages.\n  - Use \"annotation\" tags with a 'for' attribute referencing the ID of the section they are annotating.\n  - Place annotations next to the sections they are annotating.\n  - Include layout object IDs in all leaf nodes using the 'layout_ids' attribute, containing a comma-separated list of OCR layout object IDs that make up the content\n  - If the current page's page number is visibly present, set the 'number' attribute on the <page> element.\n2. IDs and References:\n   - Assign a hierarchical id to every tag/element.\n   - If continuing an element from a previous page, use continuedFrom=\"<id>\" and reuse that id.\n   - Content identifiers present within the document shall be captured in the 'reference_id' attribute of an element if applicable. This includes sections, paragraphs and other elements\n   - All elements (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that might be referenced by someone should also have reference attributes. An element is likely to be referenced if it has a heading or a numeric identifier. \n3. Correct any OCR errors you encounter and document these corrections in the decision log.\n4. Close the page tag (</page>) when you reach the end of the page.\n5. Document your decisions in the decision log. Highlight any ambiguities in the instructions, as well as any areas you feel the XML could be improved to better represent the document.\n\nAdditional Guidance:\n  - Do not include a top-level 'document' section that covers the entire document.\n  - Only set the alt attribute for images and leave the content empty\n  - If a page has no readable content, simply output <page></page>\n  - Escape invalid characters in the XML output\n  - Data inside table tags should be represented with header, column, row and cell tags. e.g:\n<table>\n    <header>\n        <column>First Name</column>\n        <column>Last Name</column>\n    </header>\n    <row>\n        <cell>John</cell>\n        <cell>Smith</cell>\n    </row>\n    <row>\n        <cell>Jane</cell>\n        <cell>Doe</cell>\n    </row>\n</table>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n\n<page>\n[Your generated XML for the current page goes here]\n</page>\n\n<decision_log>\n[Document important decisions, assumptions, corrections, and unresolved ambiguities here. Focus on scenarios where the instructions were not sufficiently clear.]\n</decision_log>\n\nRemember to:\n- Maintain consistent tag usage and structure throughout the document.\n- Maintain continuity across pages.\n- Create semantic sections that may span different visual text blocks or pages."
